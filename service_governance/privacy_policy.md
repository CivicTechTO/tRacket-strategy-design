# Privacy Policy

## Who we are

tRacket is a citizen science project which aims to balance utility with privacy. We collect as little data as possible while still creating a valuable open data set for those who’d like to advocate for a more livable urban environment. Privacy by Design was one of our key design principles: minimize data collection, be transparent, be secure.

## What information do we ask for?

Very little. When you register, we ask only for your **email address**. 

As part of the device setup, you need to input your **wifi network’s name and password** and submit an **approximate location** where the device is collecting data. 

Once the device is tracking sound levels, it collects the **maximum, minimum and average noise levels (in dBA units)** measured at 5 minute intervals. That’s it.
Why do we ask for this data and what happens with it?

Your registration information is kept private and we don’t share it with anyone:

- Your **email address** is used to access your device account and settings in the future. Make sure you have access to this email account. We will not share this information with anyone and is not linked publicly to your device or location. You might receive updates about the project in the future (which you can unsubscribe from).

How about the device setup?

- **Wifi credentials** (network name and password) – the sensor sends the noise data to a server on the internet, so it needs to connect to a wifi network to get online. The wifi credentials are stored and encrypted on the device and we never receive them. If you have a separate guest network, feel free to use that for added security (your internet provider most likely has information on how you can set this up easily).

- The **approximate location** where you are setting up the device will be **public along with the noise measurements from your device**. Note that you can adjust the precision and accuracy of the location for additional safety before publication – more on that below.

After setup, the device starts measuring noise and sending it to the server:

- The **maximum, minimum and average noise levels (in dBA units)** measured at 5 minute intervals are published in an open database and visualized on our public dashboard. This noise information is **public and linked to the approximate location** saved at setup.

## Use of Cookies

We use cookies to simplify the process of logging in. If you select “Remember me” when you log in, a cookie will be set for two weeks(?). If you log out of your account, the cookie will be removed.

## What options are available to protect your sensor’s location?

As part of the sensor setup, you are asked for the sensor’s location. This is in order for the sensor to be displayed on the dashboard map. 

You are given the option to adjust the precision and accuracy of the location:

- **Precision**: You can specify the size of the circle that will be displayed on the sensor’s dashboard page. We suggest that the sensor’s true location is somewhere in the circle.

- **Accuracy**: You can specify the location of the circle. It is not important that the sensor’s true location be at the centre of the circle.

Users can decide for themselves how precise and how accurate they would like their device’s location to be presented on the map. 

The tRacket sensor is incapable of automatically sensing its location. The sensor location can only be specified through the account setup page.

## What else can I do to best protect my privacy?

- Use a strong, unique password for your email account.
- Install your tRacket sensor in a secure location, where no one else will have physical access to it.

## What rights you have over your data

At any time you can export and download the sound data collected by your sensor(s). You can also request that we erase the sound data collected by your sensor(s).
